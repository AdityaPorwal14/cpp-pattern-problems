# C++ Pattern Printing Practice

Welcome to my collection of C++ Pattern Printing Problems!

This repository contains a wide variety of pattern problems — one of the best ways to master loops and nested loops in programming.

Whether you are just starting C++ or preparing for coding interviews, pattern problems help build strong logic and a clear understanding of how loops work.

## What’s inside

This repo currently includes:

- Star patterns  
- Number patterns  
- Alphabet patterns  
- Mixed patterns  
- Advanced and tricky patterns  

New patterns will be added regularly as I continue my practice.

## Why I built this repo

When I was learning C++, I realized that solving pattern problems really helps in:

- Understanding how loops work  
- Building problem-solving skills  
- Improving coding speed and accuracy  
- Getting ready for coding rounds in interviews  

That’s why I decided to upload all my practice codes here — so that other beginners can also learn from them.

## How to use this repo

- Clone or download the repository  
- Run the codes in any C++ compiler or IDE (CodeBlocks, Dev C++, VS Code + g++)  
- Try to understand how each pattern is built  
- Practice writing the patterns on your own

## Who this is for

- Beginner C++ students  
- Anyone learning loops and nested loops  
- Those preparing for coding interviews  
- Self-learners looking to strengthen core programming logic

If you find this helpful, feel free to star the repo. I will be adding more patterns soon.  
Happy coding!
